    <p>
        Firstly, my name is Dean Burt and I have been a qualified personal trainer since 2019. My love of fitness has always been a part of my life. So it made total sense to turn my passion for fitness training  into a qualification.  As well as transforming my own body through fitness training and good nutrition, I have helped many clients to redefine themselves through health & fitness training.  Not only sharing my knowledge, I also share personal experiences, tips and health & fitness training secrets.

<h2>Best personal training approach</h2><br>

<p>Secondly, working out with me means my clients meet their goals & even surpass their original goals. Seeing them exceed health & fitness their goals is why I do what I do. As a personal trainer my aim is to guide my clients to a better and healthier lifestyle and to help you achieve your goals.</p>

<h2>YOUR LOCAL PERSONAL TRAINER</h2><br>
<p>Lastly, having grown up in East London, of course I know the area very well. Which also means that I know all the best locations to personal train my clients.</p>
